    This is a sample of a Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client Profile XML file.

    Please refer to the Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client Administrator Guide
    for information regarding profile management and examples of all
    available options. In short:

      - A Profile should be uniquely named for your Company.  An example is:
        CiscoProfile.xml

      - The profile name should be the same even if different for individual
        group within the company.

    This file is intended to be maintained by a Secure Gateway administrator
    and then distributed with the client software.  The profile based on
    this XML can be distributed to clients at any time.  The distribution
    mechanisms supported are as a bundled file with the software distribution
    or as part of the automatic download mechanism.  The automatic download
    mechanism only available with certain Cisco Secure Gateway products.

    NOTE: Administrators are strongly encouraged to validate XML profile they
          create using an online validation tool or via the profile import
          functionality in ASDM.  Validation can be accomplished with the
          AnyConnectProfile.xsd found in this directory.


    AnyConnectProfile is the root element representing the AnyConnect Client
    Profile.

            card into it's reader.

            the case of certificate-only authentication, this will result in
            the establishment of a VPN tunnel when the client is started.

            DeviceLockRequired indicates that a Windows Mobile device must 
            be configured with a password or PIN prior to establishing a 
            VPN connection.  This configuration is only valid on Windows 
            Mobile devices that use the Microsoft Default Local 
            Authentication Provider (LAP).
            
            The following attributes can be specified to check additional 
            settings.  The platforms for which each additional check is 
            performed as specified with "WM5AKU2+" for Windows Mobile 5 with
            the Messaging and Security Feature Pack delivered as part of
            Adaption Kit Upgrade 2 (AKU2).

                    effect.  (WM5/WM5AKU2+)                   
                MinimumPasswordLength - when set to a non-negative number,
                    specifies that any PIN/password used for device lock 
                    must be equal to or longer than the specified value, 
                    in characters.  This setting must be pushed down to
                    the mobile device by syncing with an Exchange server
                    before it can be enforced. (WM5AKU2+)
                PasswordComplexity - when present checks for the following
                    password subtypes:
                        "alpha"  - Requires an alphanumeric password
                        "pin"    - Numeric PIN required
                        "strong" - Strong alphanumeric password defined by
                                   Microsoft as containing at least 7 
                                   characters, including at lesst 3 from
